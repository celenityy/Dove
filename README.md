# Dove

Dove is a suite of configurations & advanced modifications for Mozilla Thunderbird, designed to put the user first.

Dove strives to create the best email experience possible, and does so through enhancing user privacy, security, and freedom. We also include various other QOL tweaks & nice-to-have features where possible.

Dove is built off of its sister project, [Phoenix](https://codeberg.org/celenity/Phoenix), which you should also check out.
